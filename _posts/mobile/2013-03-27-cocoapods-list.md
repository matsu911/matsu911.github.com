<tr><td>BaseModel</td><td>BaseModel provides a base class for building model objects for your iOS or Mac OS projects. It saves you the hassle of writing boilerplate code, and encourages good practices by reducing the incentive to cut corners in your model implementation.

The BaseModel object uses Plists and the NSCoding protocol for serialisation. It is not designed for use with Core Data, although in principle the class could be extended to work with Core Data if needed by changing the BaseModel superclass to an NSManagedObject.

BaseModel is really designed as an alternative to Core Data for developers who prefer to have a little more control over the implementation of their data stack. BaseModel gives you precise control over the location and serialisation of your data files, whilst still proving enough automatic behaviour to save you from writing the same code over and over again.

BaseModel is designed to work with the AutoCoding and HRCoder libraries.

Instead choose a font that you won't be using anywhere in your app, e.g. Arial and use it in Interface Builder. Then create a mapping from Arial to your custom font, e.g. Caviar Dreams and let FontReplacer handle the replacement.

<tr><td>HRCoder</td><td>HRCoder is a replacement for the NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver classes. Although the NSKeyedArchiver writes data in binary Plist format, the structure of the Plist makes it hard to read, and nearly impossible to generate by hand.

The HR stands for Human Readable. HRCoder saves files in a simpler format than NSKeyedArchiver; Standard objects such as strings, dictionaries, arrays, numbers, booleans and binary data are all saved and loaded using the standard plist primitives, and any other type of object is saved as a simple dictionary, with the addition of a $class key to indicate the object type.

HRCoder is designed to work with the AutoCoding library (https://github.com/nicklockwood/AutoCoding), which can automatically write the initWithCoder: and encodeWithCoder: methods for your classes.

A swipe button has 5 symbols on it. If you simply tap it, it will produce the middle symbol. However if you swipe it (tap-and-drag) towards one of the corners, it will produce the symbol in that corner.
The navigation key (the middle one with a circle on it) allows you to navigate in the text by moving the cursor in a direction where you drag. If you drag the navigation key, the cursor will move the same way as you drag. If you double tap and drag it will start selecting text from your current position.

<tr><td>OCMockito</td><td>
OCMockito is an Objective-C implementation of Mockito, supporting creation, 
verification and stubbing of mock objects.

Key differences from other mocking frameworks:

* Mock objects are always "nice," recording their calls instead of 
  throwing exceptions about unspecified invocations. This makes tests less fragile.
* No expect-run-verify, making tests more readable. Mock objects 
  record their calls, then you verify the methods you want.
* Verification failures are reported as unit test failures, 
  identifying specific lines instead of throwing exceptions. This makes 
  it easier to identify failures. (It also keeps the pre-iOS 5 Simulator from crashing.)

<tr><td>ODIN</td><td>**What is the Open Device Identification Number?**

The Open Device Identification Number (ODIN) is a number designed for mobile app developers and service providers to uniquely identify their users’ devices in a convenient and interoperable manner. Unlike existing device identification schemes, ODIN is:

- **Anonymous** A device’s ODIN does not encode any additional information beyond differentiating it from other ODINs. Having a single ODIN does not reveal any information about the originating device’s user, make, model, etc.
- **Consistent** ODIN provides a standardized format for identifying devices regardless of software platform. Thus iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and future devices all use the same number format.
- **Secure** The ODIN specification considers device identifiers to be personal information and details precautions in its transport accordingly. Additionally, even if the identifier were to be captured no additional information would be revealed beyond a unique number.

Maintenance of ODIN is administered by an ODIN Working Group (http://www.odinmobile.org) comprised of industry developers and service providers.

<tr><td>pegged</td><td>  Pegged generates Objective-C parsers from PEG grammars. The parsers it generates are re-entrant, thread-safe, and do not leak memory: they are suitable for inclusion in other programs.

Pegged reads the grammar specified in file and will create a class of the same name. A .h and a .m file will then be created in the output directory, which may be specified from the command line and defaults to the directory containing the PEG grammar. The parser class adheres to a simple interface:

    @protocol ParserDataSource;
    typedef NSObject<ParserDataSource> ParserDataSource;
    @interface Parser : NSObject
    {
    }
    @property (retain) ParserDataSource *dataSource;

Since work started on the PROJ.4.4.x series of releases, various bug fixes have been incorporated, and the build system has been overhauled to use autoconf/libtool. Support has also been added for 3 and 7 parameter datum shifts, the PJ* structure now also carries datum information and PJ* can be considered a full coordinate system (geographic coordinate systems are also now supported with the +proj=latlong pseudo-projection). The new cs2cs program performs a similar function to the proj program, but transforming from any one coordinate system to another. The new pj_transform() is used to access the extended coordinate system to coordinate system transformation with datum shifting. Work is underway to improve ThreadSafety.

A mapping file (epsg) has also been introduced mapping most EPSG ( http://www.epsg.org/) coordinate systems to PROJ.4 format.

As of May 2008 PROJ.4 has become part of the  MetaCRS project, a confederation of coordinate systems related projects and it is hoped MetaCRS will enter incubation as an  OSGeo project.

<tr><td>SKBindingManager</td><td># SKBindingManager - lightweight bindings for iOS

`SKBindingManager` is component which allows you to easily add bindings to your code with support for ARC. 

It is designed so you can bind two objects or UIViews, or any other combination of those two. Basic purpose of this component is to enable binding between models and Views without having to write a lot of unnecessary code which handels everything.

`SKBindingManager` allows you to dynamically add or remove bindings. You can specify wheather you would like one-way or two-way binding. It has an integrated support for cycle detection in your bindings. For instance if you have object `A` with properties `a`, `b` and `c`. You will not be allowed to make bindings like this `A.a -> A.b -> A.c -> A.a` because that would cause bindings to refresh themselves indefinetly. You can also define specific transformations you want to do before for instance `A.a` refreshes object `A.b` via blocks.

##Supported objects for binding

Bindings are supported for any kind of user defined `NSObject` subclasses and in `UIKit` for `UILabel`, `UITextField`, `UITextView`, `UISwitch` and `UISlider`. But you can add support for custom `UIView` objects.

While creating an app which needed simple twitter interactions i found that all of the exisiting libraries used OOB signon.

What i have done is using the code from the facebook-ios-sdk built something that behaves the same as the facebook-ios-sdk without using OOB login for oAuth. 

The license is Apache 2.0, as i copied a lot of code from the facebook-ios-sdk. All of the copied code is in TwitterDialog.h/.m

I also copied alot of code from https://github.com/jaanus/PlainOAuth as the basis of this project. 

The credit here should really go to Facebook and Jaanus Kase because all i have done is put their code together and made something new.

It should be fairly self explanatory to use, but it was written quickly and might still be buggy. If you know of any bugs please tell me so i can fix them, or submit a pull request.

The cool thing about [ZGPullDragTableView][] is that, the header and the footer view is a complete functional `UIView`,
over which you have complete control.

Is also super easy to use, the API is very thright forward.    


After import `UITableView+ZGPullDrag.h` to you source file, `UITableView` will have two more method.

```
- (void)addZGPullView:(UIView *)pullView;
- (void)addZGDragView:(UIView *)dragView;
```

and also two more `Delegate`:

```
@property (nonatomic) id <ZGPullViewDelegate> ZGPullViewDelegate;
@property (nonatomic) id <ZGDragViewDelegate> ZGDragViewDelegate;
```

all of its delegate method are optional.

<tr><td>ZipArchive</td><td>ZipArchive is an Objective-C class to compress or uncompress zip files, which is base on open source code "MiniZip".
It can be used for iPhone application development, and cocoa on Mac OSX as well.

<tr><td>ZipKit</td><td>ZipKit is an Objective-C framework for reading and writing Zip archives in Mac OS X and iOS apps. It supports the standard PKZip format, files larger than 4GB in size using PKZip's zip64 extensions, optionally, resource forks in a manner compatible with Mac OS X's Archive Utility (in the Mac OS X targets only), and clean interruption so archiving can be cancelled by the invoking object (e.g., a NSOperation or NSThread).</td></tr>
<tr><td>zipzap</td><td>The zip file is an ideal container for compound Objective-C documents. Zip files are widely used and well understood. You can randomly access their parts. The format compresses decently and has extensive operating system and tool support. So we want to make this format an even easier choice for you. Thus, the library features:

- Easy-to-use interface: The public API offers just three classes! Yet you can look through zip files using familiar NSArray collections and properties. And you can zip, unzip and rezip zip files through familiar NSData, NSStream and Image I/O classes.
- Efficient implementation: We've optimized zip file reading and writing to reduce virtual memory pressure and disk file thrashing. Depending on how your compound document is organized, updating a single entry can be faster than writing the same data to a separate file.
- File format compatibility: Since zipzap closely follows the zip file format specification, it is works with most Mac, Linux and Windows zip tools.
